# Learn agb part II: Platformer

In this section you'll learn how to use `agb` and Tiled to make a platformer.

- Designing levels in tiled.
- Using `build.rs` to import your levels made with tiled.
- Making a very simple platformer using these imported levels.

This should then let you be able to use this knowledge in the design of your own games.

In this tutorial, there are some suggestions for additional tasks you could do.
Later chapters will assume you have not done them, so if you do decide to try the extra tasks make sure to go fresh from what you've already written into the next chapter.
