# Running an example

In this section, we will get to the point where you can build and run the game built for the GMTK game jam using agb known as 'The Hat Chooses the Wizard'.
This will prove that your development environment is ready for the future tutorials and later building.

You can run the game using real hardware and a flash card.
However, at this stage, it is much easier to play on an emulator.
agb is guaranteed to work well using [mgba](https://mgba.io/), but other emulators will also work.

Note that some emulators will require a special 'fixed' gba ROM file.
See the later steps in this section for how to do this.
