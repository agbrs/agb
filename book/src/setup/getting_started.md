# Running an example

In this section, we will get to the point where you can build and run the `agb` template repository.
This will prove that your development environment is ready for the future tutorials and later building.

You can run the game using real hardware and a flash card.
However, at this stage, it is much easier to play on an emulator.
`agb` is guaranteed to work well using [mgba](https://mgba.io/), but other emulators will also work.

Note that some emulators will require a special 'fixed' gba ROM file.
See the later steps in this section for how to do this.
