# Backgrounds

In addition to sprites, the GBA can also display up to 4 different background layers.
These can be used for various things, but the main use case for backgrounds are backdrops for the game (hence the name background) and UI elements.

These backgrounds can be stacked on top of each other to create parallax effects for example.
