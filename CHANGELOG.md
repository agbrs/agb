# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Tracker file module support provided by maxmod. You can now play your tracker modules which will allow you to include much more music before running into cartridge size limits.

### Changed
- Text renderer can now be re-used which is useful for rpg style character/word at a time text boxes.

## [0.12.2] - 2022/10/22

This is a minor release to fix an alignment issue with background tiles.

### Fixed
- Corrected alignment of background tiles which was causing issues with rendering tiles in some cases.

## [0.12.1] - 2022/10/12

This is a minor release to fix the build of the docs on [docs.rs/agb](https://docs.rs/agb).

### Fixed
- Fixed the agb crate's docs.rs build

## [0.12.0] - 2022/10/11

This version of `agb` has some exciting new features we'd like to highlight and some brand new contributors!

1. Save support for multiple cartridge types (contributed by @Lymia)
2. Affine background support (contributed by @lifning)

We also had a contribution by @ijc8. We can't thank you all enough!

### Added
- Custom allocator support using the `Allocator` trait for `HashMap`. This means the `HashMap` can be used with `InternalAllocator` to allocate to IWRAM or the `ExternalAllocator` to explicitly allocate to EWRAM.
- Support for using windows on the GBA. Windows are used to selectively enable rendering of certain layers or effects.
- Support for the blend mode of the GBA. Blending allows for alpha blending between layers and fading to black and white.
- Added a new agb::sync module that contains GBA-specific synchronization primitives.
- Added support for save files.
- Added implementation of `HashMap.retain()`.
- Added support for affine backgrounds (tiled modes 1 and 2) which allows for scaling, rotating etc of tiled backgrounds.
- Added support for 256 colour backgrounds (when working with affine ones).
- Added affine matrix module. This allows for manipulation of affine matricies for use in backgrounds and in the future objects.
- Added support for dynamic sprites generated at runtime, some parts of this may change significantly so breaking changes are expected here.

### Changed
- Many of the places that originally disabled IRQs now use the `sync` module, reducing the chance of missed interrupts.
- HashMap iterators now implement `size_hint` which should result in slightly better generation of code using those iterators.
- Transparency of backgrounds is now set once in the toml file rather than once for every image.
- Palette generation now takes into account every single background a toml definition rather than one at a time, you can now find it in the PALETTES constant rather than in every individual image.
- Sound frequency is no longer a crate feature, instead set when initialising the sound mixer.
- `testing` is now a default feature, so you no longer need to add a separate `dev-dependencies` line for `agb` in order to enable unit tests for your project.

### Fixed
- Fixed the fast magnitude function in agb_fixnum. This is also used in fast_normalise. Previously only worked for positive (x, y).
- Fixed formatting of fixed point numbers in the range (-1, 0), which previously appeared positive.

## [0.11.1] - 2022/08/02

Version 0.11.1 brings documentation for fixed point numbers. We recommend all users upgrade to this version since it also includes fixes to a few functions in fixnum. See changed section for breaking changes.

### Added
- Support for sprites that are not square.
- Docs for fixed point numbers.

### Changed
- `Rect::contains_point` now considers points on the boundary to be part of the rectangle.
- Signature of `Rect::overlapping_rect` changed to return an Option. Returns None if rectangles don't overlap.

### Fixed
- Fixed point sine calculates the sine correctly.

## [0.10.0] - 2022/07/31

Version 0.10.0 brings about many new features. As with most `agb` upgrades, you will need to update your `gba.ld` and `gba_mb.ld` files which you can find in the [template repo](https://github.com/agbrs/template). We would also recommend copying the `[profile.dev]` and `[profile.release]` sections from `Cargo.toml` if you don't have these values already.

### Added
- [Hyperspace roll](https://lostimmortal.itch.io/hyperspace-roll), a new game built for the GMTK Game Jam 2022 using `agb`. The source code can be found in the `examples` directory.
- Started using GitHub discussions as a forum
- Many functions previously undocumented are now documented
- Z-Ordering of sprites - you can now change the render order of sprites rather than it just being defined by the order in which they appear in object memory
- 32kHz audio. Probably the best sound quality you'll get out of the hardware, but uses a lot of ROM space
- Transparent sprite support with aseprite
- You can now write tests for projects depending on agb
- Very basic font rendering - looking for feedback, this API is far from stable
- Faster implementation of memcpy and memset thanks to the agbabi crate which provide a big performance boost for any project using agb
- If you wish, you can now optionally do dynamic memory allocation to IWRAM instead of only EWRAM
- You can now use 64x64px sprites
- You can now configure the background size for tiled backgrounds
- It is possible to create 'dynamic tiles' for backgrounds. These are tiles which are defined at runtime
- Random number generator in agb::rng

### Changed
- Audio system optimisations - reduced CPU usage by more than 50%
- Background tiles are now removed from Video RAM during `commit()` if they are no longer used rather than immediately reducing flickering
- Improved the README for both the main agb crate and the template
- The template now builds with optimisations in debug mode and debug symbols in release mode
- Added `#[must_use]` to many of the places it is needed
- All subcrates get released at once, so versions are kept in lockstep
- A few methods accepting `Num<..>` have been changed to accept `impl Into<Num<..>>` to make them easier to use

### Removed
- The ability to use timer0 and timer1 through the `timer` module. This was done in order to fully support 32kHz audio

### Fixed
- Sprite data is now correctly aligned so fast copies will always work
- A few methods which should really be internal have had `pub` removed
- The crate now compiles (but does not run) doctests in CI which pointed out a large number of non-compiling examples
