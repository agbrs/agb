// Games made using `agb` are no_std which means you don't have access to the standard
// rust library. This is because the game boy advance doesn't really have an operating
// system, so most of the content of the standard library doesn't apply.
#![no_std]
// `agb` defines its own `main` function, so you must declare your game's main function
// using the #[agb::entry] proc macro. Failing to do so will cause failure in linking
// which won't be a particularly clear error message.

// By default no_std crates don't get alloc, so you won't be able to use things like Vec
// until you declare the extern crate. `agb` provides an allocator so it will all work
