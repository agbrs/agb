# AGB code of conduct

This is based heavily on the [Rust Code of conduct](https://www.rust-lang.org/policies/code-of-conduct).
The enforcement section is based on the [django project's](https://www.djangoproject.com/conduct/enforcement-manual/).

## Definitions

1. `we` or `us` is defined as any [member of the agbrs GitHub organisation](https://github.com/agbrs).
2. `Forum` is any public space managed by the agbrs organisation. This includes but is not limited to:
   - GitHub discussions.
   - Issues and pull requests.
   - Any emails sent to us.

## Conduct

- We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all, regardless of level of experience, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, personal appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, age, religion, nationality, or other similar characteristic.
- Please avoid using overtly sexual aliases or other nicknames that might detract from a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all.
- Please be kind and courteous. There’s no need to be mean or rude.
- Respect that people have differences of opinion and that every design or implementation choice carries a trade-off and numerous costs. There is seldom a right answer.
- Please keep unstructured critique to a minimum. If you have solid ideas you want to experiment with, make a fork and see how it works.
- We will exclude you from interaction if you insult, demean or harass anyone. That is not welcome behaviour. We interpret the term "harassment" as including the definition in the [Citizen Code of Conduct](https://github.com/stumpsyn/policies/blob/master/citizen_code_of_conduct.md); if you have any lack of clarity about what might be included in that concept, please read their definition. In particular, we don’t tolerate behaviour that excludes people in socially marginalized groups.
- Private harassment is also unacceptable. No matter who you are, if you feel you have been or are being harassed or made uncomfortable by a community member, please contact one of the [members of the agbrs organisation](https://github.com/agbrs). Whether you’re a regular contributor or a newcomer, we care about making this community a safe place for you and we’ve got your back.
- Likewise any spamming, trolling, flaming, baiting or other attention-stealing behaviour is not welcome.

In the agb community we strive to go the extra step to look out for each other. Don’t just aim to be technically unimpeachable, try to be your best self. In particular, avoid flirting with offensive or sensitive issues, particularly if they’re off-topic; this all too often leads to unnecessary fights, hurt feelings, and damaged trust; worse, it can drive people away from the community entirely.

And if someone takes issue with something you said or did, resist the urge to be defensive. Just stop doing what it was they complained about and apologize. Even if you feel you were misinterpreted or unfairly accused, chances are good there was something you could've communicated better — remember that it’s your responsibility to make your fellow gba developers comfortable. Everyone wants to get along and we are all here first and foremost because we want to talk about cool technology. You will find that people will be eager to assume good intent and forgive as long as you earn their trust.

Just as we encourage offering sincere apologies when mistakes are made, we also ask that community members accept apologies when they are given in good faith. Holding grudges or repeatedly bringing up past mistakes can create an unwelcoming environment and prevent growth. We recognize that not every harm can be immediately repaired, but fostering a culture of understanding and resolution helps keep our community constructive and welcoming.

## Enforcement

We are a very small team, but for any reports of violations of the code of conduct or things we see in our forums will be reviewed to the best of our ability based on what happened. We will take one of the following actions:

- Taking no further action (if we determine no violation occurred).
- A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved. In this case, one of us will deliver that reprimand to the individual(s) over email.
- A public reprimand. In this case, we will deliver that reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e. in the forum for a forum violation; email for an email violation, etc.). We may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
- An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from the forum). We will communicate this "vacation" to the individual(s). They'll be asked to take this vacation voluntarily, but if they don't agree then a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this vacation.
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all agb spaces (the forum, etc.). The committee will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to new agb fora, or otherwise maintained.
- A request for a public or private apology. We will deliver this request. We may, if we choose, attach "strings" to this request: for example, we may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain their membership on the forum.

In cases where the violation was reported, we will respond to the reporter with our decision via a private channel provided one exists with the reporter.

We make no promises on our response time for reports, but we will do our best to be as fast as possible to keep the agb project space inclusive.
