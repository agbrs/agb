#![warn(missing_docs)]
//! # Sprites and objects
//!
//! There are two implementations of objects depending on how you want to make
//! your game. There is the *Managed* and *Unmanaged* systems, given by
//! [OamManaged] and [OamUnmanaged] respectively. The managed Oam is easier to
//! use and has built in support for setting the `z` coordinate. The unmanaged
//! Oam is simpler and more efficient with the tradeoff that it is slightly
//! harder to integrate into your games depending on how they are architectured.
